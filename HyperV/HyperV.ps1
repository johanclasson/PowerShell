Content moved to HyperV-WorkaroundMountDiskImageProblem.ps1 because mounting a
VHDX disk image in an elevated session from a psm1-file would result in "Cannot
find drive. A drive with the name 'G' does not exist." when trying to access it.

Strangely the error disappeared when run from a normal ps1-skript.
